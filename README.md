# Create React App for Azure App Services

A mixture of [Azure-Samples/nodejs-docs-hello-world](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/nodejs-docs-hello-world) and [facebook/create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

## Setup

For the `npm run build` script to work the server will need to use node >= 6

To set the node version go to App Settings and add the App Setting `WEBSITE_NODE_DEFAULT_VERSION` and set the value to the node version you want to use.
